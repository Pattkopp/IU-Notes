\section{Summary}
In this unit, sequences were first introduced. The individual sequence links are formed according to a law, so that the order of a sequence is fixed. If the sequence were to be changed, another sequence would be created.

If within this order the sequence links become larger and larger with increasing index, the sequence is called (strictly) monotonically growing. If they become smaller and smaller, the sequence is (strictly) monotonically falling. If there is a fixed value that the sequence does not exceed for all indices, the sequence is called restricted upwards. If there is such a barrier, below which no sequence element falls, the sequence is limited downwards. If there is both an upper and a lower limit, the sequence is restricted. If, as the index rises, a sequence keeps approaching a fixed value, which it never quite reaches but never exceeds or falls below, then this sequence converges towards a limit value. For this to happen, an infinite number of sequence elements must lie in an arbitrarily small environment around the limit value, a very small interval. Only a finite number of sequence elements may be outside this environment. If the limit value of two sequences is known, then according to the limit value theorems, the limit value of the sequence composed of the known sequences can also be determined, regardless of whether the composed sequence is the sum, the difference, the product, or the quotient of the known sequences.

If the difference, or distance, between two successive sequence elements is always constant, the sequence is called arithmetic. If, on the other hand, the quotient of two successive sequence elements is always the same, then it is a geometric sequence.

If more and more of the sequence elements are summed up, a new sequence is created from the sums, which is called a series. Each series thus depends on a corresponding sequence. The links of the series form the so-called partial sums. If the corresponding sequence has an infinite number of sequence elements, there are also infinite partial sums and this is called an infinite series. As with the sequences, one is interested in knowing when this infinite series converges, i.e., when it approaches a limit value and does not grow to infinity. A series can only converge if its associated sequence is a zero sequence, i.e., a convergent sequence with a limit value of $0$. However, the reverse is not always true. This means that there can also be series of zero sequences that do not converge.

If the associated sequence is an arithmetic or a geometric sequence, an arithmetic or geometric series is created accordingly.

For a geometric series it is known that it converges exactly when the constant quotient of the sequence is truly less than $1$.

Important figures in the analysis are limit values of sequences and series. Thus, Euler's constant e can be determined as the limit value of a sequence and a series. Also the important type of function of polynomials can be introduced via the partial sums of the power series. Altogether, the consideration of sequences and series forms the basis for many further concepts of analysis.

\section{Summary}
A function is a mapping rule that uniquely assigns an element from the value range to each element from the definition area. Important functions are the identity function, the constant function, and the amount function. Graphs visualize the point pairs of a function, consisting of input value and function value, in a coordinate system.

Linear and quadratic functions were introduced as elementary functions. If you extend the functions further according to this pattern, you get completely rational functions of degree n, also called polynomial functions. With the help of composition, elementary functions can be combined with other functions as desired.

Important properties such as surjectivity and injectivity determine whether inverse functions exist. If an inverse function has been found, it is unique and also invertible.

The general exponential functions represent another family of functions. The natural exponential function, also called e-function, forms a special case with the base e, Euler’s constant. Exponential functions can be used to describe growth and decay processes. The inverse functions to the exponential functions form the logarithmic functions.

The trigonometric functions assign lengths to angles in the unit circle. Due to their periodicity, the function values of the trigonometric functions repeat themselves again and again and are therefore suitable for modeling completely different relationships than the function families introduced previously.

\subsection{Partial derivation}

\[
  \frac{\delta f}{\delta x_1} = \frac{\delta}{\delta x_1}f = f'_{x1}
\]

\subsection{Summary}

In this lesson the difference quotient was introduced as the slope of the secant between two points of a function. If these two points approach each other more and more, the secant becomes a tangent at only one point of the function. The slope of this tangent is calculated with the differential quotient and is also called the first derivative of the function.

Subsequently the derivatives of many elementary functions were given. In order to be able to derive complex or compound functions, the sum, product, quotient and chain rules were introduced.

By repeated derivation you get the higher derivatives of the function. With the help of these, trigonometric functions, for example, can be represented by polynomial functions, which makes the calculation in pocket calculators, for example, less complicated. The Taylor series and Taylor polynomials were introduced for this purpose.

Finally, curve sketching introduced a set of instruments that can be used to determine the behavior of any function on the essential points.

\subsection{Integration Rules}

\subsubsection{Factor rule}

Constant factors are retained

\[
  \int a \; f(x)dx = a \int f(x)dx
\]

\subsubsection{Total integration link by link}

\[
  \int (f(x) + g(x))dx = \int f(x)dx + \int g(x)dx
\]

\subsubsection{Integration rules}

\[
  \int a \; dx = a \int 1 \; dx = ax + C \text{ for } A, C  \in \mathbb{R} 
\]

\[
  \int x^adx = \frac{1}{a+1}x^{a+1} + C \text{ for } a, C \in \mathbb{R}, a \ne -1
\]

\[
  \int e^x \; dx = e^x + C \text{ for } C \in \mathbb{R}
\]

\[
  \int e^{ax} \; dx = \frac{1}{a}e^{ax} + C \text{ for } a, C \in \mathbb{R}, a \ne 0
\]

\[

\section{The Definite Integral and the Law of Differentials and Integrals}

  \toprule
  \textbf{Term} & \textbf{Description} \\
  \midrule
  Determined integral & Over an interval with the limits $a$ and $b$, an indefinite becomes a definite integral, which corresponds to the content of the area enclosed by the function graph and the $x-axis$ between the interval limits.\\
  \bottomrule
\end{tabular}

\subsection{Main Theorem of Differential and Integral Calculus}

The area $A$ between the function graph of the function $f(x)$ and the $x-axi$ is calculated according to the law of differential and integral calculs from the determined integral of the function $f(x)$:

\[
  A = \int_a^b f(x)dx = [F(x)_a^b-F(b)-F(a)]
\]

\textit{"Integral from $a$ to $b$ via the function $f$ of $x\; dx$"}

It is assumed that $f(x)$ is defined over the whole interval $[a,b]$ and is continuous.

\subsubsection{Factor rule}
A constant factor  $c \ in \mathbb{R}$ can be drawn before the integral:

\[
  \int_a^b c \cdot f(x)dx = c \cdot \int_a^b f(x) dx
\]

\subsubsection{Summation rule}
A finite sum of functions can be integrated member by member.

\[
  \int_a^b (f_1(x) + f_2(x) + \dots +f_n(x))dx = \int 
\]

\subsubsection{Exchanging rule}

If the two integration limits are exchanged, the sign of the integral changes:
\[
  \int_a^b f(x)dx = - \int_b^a f(x)dx
\]

\subsubsection{Decomposition rule}

If the integration interval $[a, b]$ is divided into two partial areas at the position $c$, so that $a \le c \le b$ then the following applies:
\[
  \int_a^b f(x)dx = \int_a^c f(x)dx + \_c^b f(x) dx
\]

\section{Outlook: Partial Differential Equations}

\section{Summary}

In this lesson differential equations were introduced. These are equations where there is a relationship between a function and its derivatives. The solutions of differential equations are not numbers but functions.

It is an ordinary differential equation if it depends on only one variable. The order of a differential equation is determined by the highest derivative that occurs in the equation.

Differential equations are indispensable in the modeling of real properties and their changes in physics, chemistry, engineering or economics. With their help a multitude of processes can be mathematically described and solved. Some problems can be solved explicitly, others only approximately with numerical methods.

Easily-solvable are linear homogeneous differential equations of the first order. Homogeneous means that there is a zero on the right side of the differential equation. If the value of zero is different from zero, we speak of non-homogeneous differential equations.

The solution of these simple differential equations is achieved by integration and the application of integration rules. A general solution of a differential equation is understood to be a set of functions which, except for a constant factor, specifies the type of solution. The set of functions can be sketched in a directional field. If an initial condition is given, it is possible to determine a special solution for which alone the initial condition is exactly fulfilled.

To solve a linear non-homogeneous differential equation of the first order, the general solution of the corresponding homogeneous equation can be used. If a special solution of the non-homogeneous differential equation is added to this, the general solution of the non-homogeneous equation is obtained. With an non-homogeneous differential equation, for example, processes with limited growth, which are thus subject to an upper or lower bound, can be modeled and solved.
